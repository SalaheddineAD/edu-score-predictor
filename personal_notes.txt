To activate environement : conda activate "env_name"

To install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt 
and if -e. is in the requirements.txt then it will create the folder info once again so better to comment it.

To use logger: need to from "src."logger import logging. then you can specify the logging info (see logger.py for example)
